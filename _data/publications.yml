  abstract: |
    Personalized medicine uses Clinical Role Models (CRMs) -- individuals with similar health profiles -- 
    to build patient trust. However, CRM identification is challenged by data scarcity and privacy 
    constraints. While Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) can synthesize CRMs, they risk generating 
    invalid *hallucinations* and face inconsistencies from evolving risk-scoring tools. 
    
    We propose CASE (Constraint-Aware active SElfimproving fine-tuning), which integrates data-driven 
    optimization with MLLM's generative capabilities to produce reliable CRMs. CASE employs a 
    robust-optimization-based verifier to ensure CRMs are clinically valid, meeting patient requirements and 
    reducing risk. Verified examples are then used to fine-tune the MLLM in a self-improving loop. We 
    developed an active learning algorithm with utility-driven sampling and provide rigorous theoretical 
    guarantees including high-probability sublinear regrets of the learning algorithm and patient safety 
    guarantees of CASE. From clinical and survey data, we found that generated CRMs outperform real CRMs 
    by> 130% in reliability and 23% in Effort-to-Change reduction. We also found that a clear learning 
    signal determines the outcomes of the fine-tuned model. Our work presents a novel integration of 
    data-driven optimization and generative AI to enhance trust and decision-making in personalized medicine.

  abstract: |
    **Problem definition:** Efforts to mitigate the U.S. opioid crisis have been complicated by 
    ever-changing trends in opioid overdose deaths (OODs) across communities and drug types. 
    Public health surveillance efforts are hampered by these challenges, making prediction of 
    local OOD trends and coordination across communities critical. 
    In this research, we design a model-based public health surveillance system capable of leveraging 
    implicit connections between past and future OODs, thereby operating across locales and providing 
    accurate local and global forecasts and unique insights of OOD trends. 
    
    **Methodology/results:** We develop a spatiotemporal mutually exciting point process with dynamic 
    network (STEMMED): a point process network wherein each node models a unique community–drug event stream 
    with a dynamic mutually exciting structure, accounting for influences from other nodes. STEMMED 
    can be decomposed node-by-node, suggesting that it can be tractably parameterized via distributed 
    learning. Leveraging this decomposability, we outline an online cooperative forecasting procedure among 
    local communities and characterize data-sharing approaches among local entities, including strategies 
    based on drug types, geographical affiliations, and proximity. We then conduct a numerical study 
    wherein we parameterize STEMMED using individual-level OOD data and city-level demographics in
    Massachusetts. In our off-line analysis, we identify a notable cluster formation process of OODs 
    centered around Boston. Additionally, our analysis indicates a growing link between fentanyl and 
    psychostimulants over time. Then, in the online model deployment setting, we find that STEMMED 
    outperforms well-established forecasting models and that drug-based data-sharing policies across cities 
    offer advantages over distance-based county-based and distance-based data-sharing policies. 
    Further, a STEMMED-based OOD surveillance system achieves more than 40% improvement in detection delays 
    relative to evidence-based surveillance systems that are currently hindered by considerable data lags. 
    
    **Managerial implications:** STEMMED provides accurate forecasts of local OOD trends and highlights 
    complex interactions between OODs across communities and drug types, informing the design and facilitating 
    the timing of impactful policy interventions."

  abstract: |
    Emergency pandemic disease surveillance encompasses a suite of public health data-based measures to
    monitor and prevent further spread of disease. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, one important method for 
    monitoring local spread of infection involved the deployment of local testing sites. 
    However, key concerns for the accuracy and completeness of any surveillance system include local access 
    to testing sites, precision in the estimates of disease incidence and prediction of its spatiotemporal 
    trajectory, and racial equity in testing availability, concerns often not rigorously taken into account 
    in public health policy-making, especially during a public health emergency. In addition, the rapid local 
    transmission dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak often require methods able to react to spontaneous 
    hotspots and disease clusters in or near real-time. To address these competing objectives, we integrate 
    Bayesian spatiotemporal disease modeling using COVID-19 case data into a multi-objective optimization 
    solved by an interior-point approach. We show the adaptive multi-objective method outperforms non-adaptive 
    test-site allocation in terms of time and resources required, and sacrifices minimal performance compared 
    to methods optimizing a single objective criteria. We hope our method can be used to improve test-site 
    allocation procedures for future local and seasonal outbreaks and broader pandemics.

  abstract: |
    Efforts to mitigate public health crises have been complicated by unreported cases and the ever-changing 
    trends of those monitored health events across geographic regions and socioeconomic cultures. To resolve 
    both challenges, we propose a Bayesian spatiotemporal susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-removed 
    (BayST-SEIRD) framework that builds the hidden effects of neighboring communities, local features, and 
    the reporting rates into its transmission mechanism. To alleviate the computational burdens embedded in a 
    fully Bayesian algorithm, we propose an alternating approach that learns the compartmental structure and 
    the spatial effects separately. With a simulation study, we show that this algorithm can accurately 
    retrieve our designed system. Then, we apply BayST-SEIRD to model the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
    dynamics in the metropolitan Atlanta area. We observe that most counties' reporting rates were below 10% 
    of the projected total infected population and that age and educational level are negatively correlated 
    with the exposing rate, suggesting the needs for stronger incentives for COVID-19 testing and quarantine 
    among the younger population. Importantly, BayST-SEIRD facilitates the reconstruction of actual case 
    counts of the monitored subject among neighboring communities, which is critical to designing impactful 
    public health policy interventions.
