# Your bio/about content (supports Markdown)
content: |
  I am a **PhD Candidate in Machine Learning** at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, 
  developing **robust AI systems** for real-world high-stakes applications. My work integrates 
  methods from **AI/ML**, **Statistics**, and **Operations Research**.

  My current research focuses on **data-efficient personalized LLMs** and **constrained alignment**. 
  I developed a **provably safe personalized RL** and validated it on treatment recommendations 
  by **fusing tabular survey data and multivariate clinical time series**, achieving **+130% 
  reliability** in generated treatment trajectories and **-23% patient effort-to-change**,
  compared to real treatment trajectories and benchmark algorithms.

  On the industry side, I interned at **Meta**, where I optimized **early-stage ads ranking** via advanced 
  **deep learning architectures** and **foundation model knowledge distillation**, while building **end-to-end 
  validation pipelines** from data ingestion to deployment.
  
  I enjoy **cross-functional collaboration**, with extensive experience working with 
  **researchers and engineers**
  on theoretical and technical constraints (Meta, Bosch) and partnering with **medical practitioners** 
  on 
  clinical validity (Michigan Medicine, Emory Hospital, VA Hospital, Georgia DPH).

  *<mark>I am actively seeking an AI Research Scientist position starting in May 2026.</mark>*
  I am especially interested in roles focused on efficient LLM/Agent personalization and alignment for 
  business process modeling.
