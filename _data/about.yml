  I am a **PhD Candidate in Machine Learning** at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, 
  developing **robust AI systems** for real-world high-stakes applications by integrating 
  **AI/ML**, **Statistics**, and **Operations Research** methods from a **data-centric perspective**.
  My recent research directions include data-efficient personalized LLMs, constrained alignment,
  and knowledge distillation from foundation models. Feel free to contact for research collaborations or just to say hi!

      Our paper, *Augmenting Individualized Treatment Planning via Data-Driven Clinical Role Model Selection*, 
      is a finalist for the **CHOM Best Paper Award** at the 2026 POMS Annual Conference! 
      This work addresses how distribution shifts, caused by frequent updates to AI/ML health tools, 
      affect the recommendation of clinical role models — prior cases similar 
      to the current patient — and the subsequent treatment planning.
      The winner will be announced in Reno, NV, May 7–11. Fingers crossed!

      Our new paper, *Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation via Distributionally Robust Regularization*,
      tackles distribution shifts in time series imputation — a common challenge due to nonstationarity and
      structural missing patterns. Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00844)!
